# Three handy apps rolled into one!

### A stopwatch, a to-do list and a date & time display! Made simply to practice the joys of Vanilla JS.

## User Journey: 
1. On load the user is displayed three buttons - from there they can choose which app they want to open.
2. The 'Date & Time' button opens a pop-up of the current date and time, updated by the second!
3. The 'To Do List' button opens a pop-up of a do-list which allows the user to add items, cross the out (or uncross) each item and delete the items.
4. The 'Stopwatch' button opens a pop-up of a stopwatch, which the user can start, pause or reset and anytime.
5. The user always has the option to go back to the home page (with the buttons) but clicking on the house button in the top-right corner.

**Extra notes:** I'm am now making another version of this in React [(check it out here soon)](https://github.com/mariaalouisaa/3-in-1-reacts) and am really enjoying how differnct the code is between the two versions!

*App designed, coded and maintained entirely by myself!*
